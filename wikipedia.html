            <h1>Comics</h1>
            <p>Comics are a vibrant form of visual storytelling that seamlessly combines illustrations and text<br>
                 to narrate engaging stories, convey profound ideas, or deliver humor.<br>
                 They typically consist of sequential art presented in panels, guiding readers through the narrative visually.<br>
                 Speech balloons bring characters to life by showcasing their dialogues,<br>
                 while captions provide additional context or narration. Onomatopoeia adds a dynamic element,<br>
                 bringing sound effects into the visual realm, enhancing the immersive experience. Comics span a variety of genres,<br>
                 including action, fantasy, romance, and satire, appealing to diverse audiences.<br>
                 Their unique blend of art and storytelling makes them a powerful medium of expression.</p>

            <h1>History of Comics</h1>
            <p>
                The origins of comics can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where visual storytelling played a crucial role in communication.<br>
                Egyptian hieroglyphs, with their intricate sequences of images and symbols, depicted stories of gods and daily life.
                <br> Similarly, Roman achievements like Trajan's Column used detailed carvings to narrate Emperor Trajan's victories in the Dacian Wars.
                <br> These early examples showcase how humans have long used visuals to convey complex narratives.
                <br> The modern form of comics began to take shape in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,<br>
                primarily in newspapers and magazines, blending illustrations with text to entertain and inform.
                <br> This evolution marked the birth of a medium that continues to captivate audiences worldwide.
